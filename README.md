## **Samyang FMCG Supply Chain & Retail Analytics Dashboard**


An interactive Power BI dashboard built on FMCG dummy data to analyze zone-wise retail demand, warehouse performance, competitor impact, and supply–demand gaps for Samyang Noodles.

---

## Purpose

This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze FMCG retail distribution and supply chain performance using dummy data provided during academic sessions. The dashboard focuses on understanding demand patterns, warehouse efficiency, logistics performance, and competitive intensity for the Samyang Noodles product line.

---

## Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- Power BI Desktop – Primary data visualization and reporting tool  
- Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creation of calculated measures, KPIs, and conditional logic  
- Data Modeling – Relationships built across warehouse, retail, distributor, and competitor datasets  
- File Format – `.pbix` for dashboard development and `.png` for report previews  

---

## Data Source

**Source:** Dummy FMCG dataset provided by the lecturer during academic training sessions  

**Brand Reference:** Samyang Noodles  

The dataset simulates a real-world FMCG supply chain and retail environment and includes:

- Warehouse information (capacity size, region, supply levels, risk score)
- Retail shop counts by zone
- Distributor-level demand
- Urban vs rural demand classification
- Competitor presence across markets
- Distance from hub and supply efficiency indicators

**Note:**  
All data used in this project is synthetic and created strictly for learning, analysis, and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Features 

### Business Problem

FMCG companies operate in complex, high-volume supply chains where inefficient inventory allocation, poor demand forecasting, and intense competition can directly impact profitability and service levels.

Key business questions addressed in this dashboard include:
- Which zones contribute the highest retail demand?
- Where are warehouses under-supplied or over-supplied?
- How does competitor density impact retail presence?
- Is warehouse distance affecting supply efficiency?
- What operational risks exist across the supply network?

---

### Goal of the Dashboard

The objective of this dashboard is to provide an analytical tool that:
- Evaluates zone-wise retail demand and market distribution
- Identifies supply-demand mismatches across warehouses
- Highlights operational inefficiencies and risk areas
- Supports data-driven decision-making in FMCG supply chain planning
